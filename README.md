<h4>II Name and Machine Folder Setup</h4>
In the Name box, enter any name you prefer. I chose born_to_be_root.

In the Machine Folder, I selected goinfre/yadib/born_2_be_root.
This is because on computures  we use in 1337 or 42, you might run out of memory.
To prevent disk space issues, we use goinfre to ensure the project runs smoothly without running into memory problems.
(If you're working on this project on your own computer, or
if you're not a student, you can use any folder or storage location you prefer to work on the project.)

in type box choose (linux)

and in version Box use (debian 64)

Set the file size to 12 GB if you're working on the project without the bonus. If you're working on the bonus part of the project, set the file size to 30.80 GB.

Next, click on VDI because we are working with an ISO file. For Storage, set it to Dynamically Allocated.
And click "Create"

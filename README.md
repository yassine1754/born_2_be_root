<h4>II Name and Machine Folder Setup</h4>
In the Name box, enter any name you prefer. I chose born_to_be_root.

In the Machine Folder, I selected goinfre/yadib/born_2_be_root. This is important on shared or limited storage systems to avoid running out of memory. (If you're working on your own system, you can use any folder or storage location you prefer.)

Type: Select Linux.

Version: Select Debian 64-bit.
